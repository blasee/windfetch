Description: Wind fetch is the unobstructed length of water over which wind can
    blow from a certain direction. The wind fetch is typically calculated for many directions
    around the compass rose for a given location, which can then be incorporated 
    into a larger model, or simply averaged for a reasonable measure of 
    the overall wind exposure for a specific location. The process of calculating
    wind fetch can be tedious, particularly if a large
    number of fetch vectors are required at many locations. The 'windfetch' package
    calculates wind fetch and summarises the information efficiently. There is
    also a plot method to help visualise the wind exposure at the various
    locations, and it's easy to write out to a shape file for further investigation.
